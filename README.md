No server side here as you can see, all you need to do to get started is:

```ls
npm i // installs all dependencies
gulp // starts gulpfile.js which compiles js (babel), and sass
```

Directories

- `/assets` Holds all precompiled static js/sass files compiles to `/build`
- `/build` Holds all compiled js/css files and all files that are avalible to user
